My work mainly consists of the C++ components and the build system. But I also want to get my hands dirty with our linux kernel later. Outside of the work I try to try out new technologies and implement the existing stack from scratch. This website mostly serves as a diary to share the things I am working on weekends. If you want to contact for any reason, you can reach me via Linkedin.","link":"/project/about/index.html"}]}
