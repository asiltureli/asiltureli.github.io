# About me

I am currently a Software Developer at Rohde & Schwarz Cybersecurity in Berlin, participating in the development of Layer-2 based network encryption systems for protecting govermental and critical infrastructures. My previous work at other companies and current work mainly consist of the C++ components and the build/meta-build system(CMake). Outside of the work I try to try out new technologies and implement the existing stack from scratch. This website mostly serves as a diary to share some interesting things I am working on in my free time. If you want to ask/discuss about anything I share or contact me for any reason, you can always reach via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/masiltureli). You can also listen to my music on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/asilt) account.
